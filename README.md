# maze_generator
A graphical maze generator

Hello Sir, for this review I didn't merge the solve part because it wause in updating.

But you can pull the repo on this [link](https://github.com/femifacia/maze_generator)

To exec this program just launch the main.py file at the root of the repository

My apologize for the lake of informations about dependencies; You will just need to install pygame by

    python -m install pygame
